# LanguageConnundrum
Looking at the distribution of the different Languages of India based on State adoption and Population


I certainly do not believe we should have one language imposed on us. That's my belief and bias. And this is supported by our Constitution itself where every state has a language supported by English so that legal proceedings can continue. Yet, I wanted to see how the data reflects when it comes to language, population and states/UT.  

Took data from Wikipedia pages : 
1) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_States_by_most_popular_languages
2) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_and_union_territories_of_India_by_population
3) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_and_union_territories_of_India_by_area

The data does not have Ladakh since one of the sources did not have Ladakh in its entry. The data also considers Hindi to be the first language of the state for Bihar, Jharkhand, Haryana, UP, and UK. If these 5 state entities get altered, the rest of the data will get changed as well. 

We have 28 states as per the dataset and 8 UT(excluding Ladakh). So a total of 36 state entities. 

Here are the following 'naive' findings:
1) As per the data, 10 state entities have Hindi as their first language. So 27.7% of the country has Hindi as their first language.  
2) In terms of population, 46.7%  have Hindi as first language.
3) In terms of land size, roughly 44% of India (by area) has Hindi as the first language.

This is an extremely naive approach and would be really interesting to see if more data points could be added to the dataset to create a better representation of data for this Language Connundrum.
